Portfolio about a design project for a course HTI.110 - Ihmisen ja teknologian vuorovaikutus 2: Suunnittelu. Course was offered by Tampere University. The project has been done in a three person group. Everyone participated in the user research and other parts of the design process. The goal was to come up with a service and then implement a coherent design for both mobile and desktop. In the actual Figma design I've mainly been in charge of the map view:

KeptOver is an application that's aim is to reduce food waste in student communities. The application has gotten influence from the popularily known application ResQ. But here the focus is on student housing communities and individuals rather than restaurants. Give food to your neighbours or go collect some from them to prevent anything going bad. On top of the exchange feature, the app offers a feed specifically themed with food waste prevention and recipes.
